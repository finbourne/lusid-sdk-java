## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**startDate** | **OffsetDateTime** | The start date of the instrument. This is normally synonymous with the trade-date. | 
**maturityDate** | **OffsetDateTime** | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates that may well be observed or set prior to the maturity date, but refer to a termination date beyond it. |
