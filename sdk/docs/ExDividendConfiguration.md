## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**useBusinessDays** | **Boolean** | Is the ex-dividend period counted in business days or calendar days.  Defaults to false if not set. |  [optional] |
|**exDividendDays** | **Integer** | Number of days in the ex-dividend period.  If the settlement date falls in the ex-dividend period then the coupon paid is zero and the accrued interest is negative.  If set, this must be a non-negative number.  If not set, or set to 0, than there is no ex-dividend period. |  |
|**returnNegativeAccrued** | **Boolean** | Does the accrued interest go negative in the ex-dividend period, or does it go to zero. |  [optional] |
|**applyThirty360PayDelay** | **Boolean** | Set this flag to true if the ex-dividend days represent a pay delay from the accrual end date in calendar  days under the 30/360 day count convention. The typical use case for this flag are Mortgage Backed Securities  with pay delay between 1 and 60 days, such as FreddieMac and FannieMae. If this flag is set, the useBusinessDays  setting will be ignored.  Defaults to false if not provided. |  [optional] |
