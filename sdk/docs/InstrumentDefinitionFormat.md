# InstrumentDefinitionFormat

What is the provenance of an instrument. This defines who creates/owns it, what format it is in (e.g. a proprietary format or a common and known one)   and what the version of that is.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**sourceSystem** | **String** | which source system does the format originate from |  |
|**vendor** | **String** | An instrument will potentially have been created by any number of different organisations. Some will be understood completely (e.g. LUSID&#39;s), some won&#39;t.   The provenance of an instrument indicates who \&quot;owns\&quot; the associated format. |  |
|**version** | **String** | Version of the document. Would be preferable to avoid the need, but LUSID will not control other organisations&#39; trade formats. |  |
