# AggregationOptions

Options for controlling the default aspects and behaviour of the aggregation.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**useAnsiLikeSyntax** | **Boolean** | Should the aggregation behave like ANSI Sql or MySql with respect to a conceptual request which is equivalent to \&quot;select a,sum(a) from results\&quot;;  ANSI Sql would report an error if a was not unique where MySql would simply view a,suma(a) as equivalent to firstof(a),sum(a). |  [optional] |
|**allowPartialEntitlementSuccess** | **Boolean** | In the case of valuing a portfolio group where some, but not all entitlements fail, should the aggregation return the valuations  applied only to those portfolios where entitlements checks succeeded. |  [optional] |
|**applyIso4217Rounding** | **Boolean** | Various results that are units of currency might need to be rounded.  This will round according to the ISO4217 standard number of decimal places for a currency. |  [optional] |
