# MarketOptions

The set of options that control miscellaneous and default market resolution behaviour.  These are aimed at a 'crude' level of control for those who do not wish to fine tune the way that data is resolved.  For clients who wish to simply match instruments to prices this is quite possibly sufficient. For those wishing to control market data sources  according to requirements based on accuracy or timeliness it is not. In more advanced cases the options should largely be ignored and rules specified  per source. Be aware that where no specified rule matches the final fallback is on to the logic implied here.
